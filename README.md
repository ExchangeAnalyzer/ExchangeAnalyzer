# Exchange Analyzer

[Exchange Analyzer](https://github.com/ExchangeAnalyzer/ExchangeAnalyzer/) is a PowerShell tool that scans an Exchange Server 2013 or 2016 organization and reports on a series of checks for common configuration issues and recommended practices.

Exchange Analyzer is a community project that has reached feature completion. It is not a complete best practices analyzer, nor should it be considered a complete Exchange organization health check.

Exchange Analyzer is no longer in active development. You can maintain Exchange Analyzer's reporting accuracy by:
- Updating the build numbers XML file after each quarterly release using [this script](https://github.com/ExchangeAnalyzer/BuildNumbersXMLFile)
- Manually updating the /Data/NETFXSupportMatrix.csv file to match the [Exchange Supportability Matrix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/plan-and-deploy/supportability-matrix?view=exchserver-2019#microsoft-net-framework)
